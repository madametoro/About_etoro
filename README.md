My full name is Ekong Etoro-obong Emmanuel and I  am from Akwaibom state in Nigeria. I studied computer science in school and I'm looking forward to actually build and earn from my skills.
I am the last of three children and one of two sisters.
it is no use telling you about myself if I do not mention Christ, becuase I  am nothing and He is all. Christ our Lord and Saviour bore the wrath of God for our sins, He has overcome death, and because He lives, He is our very hope, that no matter how bad life gets, we have an eternal home with Him. I pray for hearts to turn to Christ.
